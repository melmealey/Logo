## Description

The application generates a simple logo using the inputs the user gives with each prompt. The logo is saved as an SVG image.
ScreenCastify is used to make a walkthrough screenshare showing how the code works and renders logos.

## Intallation
You will need to install Node.JS
You will need to install Jest
You will need to install Inquirer.js


## Usage
You can create a simple logo choosing between 3 different shapes, the color of the shape, as well as including up to 3 characters and choosing their color as well. You may use this when creating a simple logo for your company so that you don't have to hire a graphic designer.
